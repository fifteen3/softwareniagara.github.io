Software Niagara is hosting its first Software Coworking event on Monday October 22, 2012 at Starbucks Coffee Company on Lake Street in St. Catharines. 

According to Wikipedia, 'Coworking is the social gathering of a group of people who are still working independently, but who share values, and who are interested in the synergy that can happen from working with like-minded talented people in the same space.' If that sounds interesting to you, than you should come out to this event.

The coworking scene in Niagara is alive and well. A group meets every Wednesday from 1:00PM to 4:00PM at Mahtay Cafe and Lounge to cowork. It's a positive atmosphere to get your work done with fellow creatives. We were so impressed by the atmosphere at Coworking Niagara that we wanted to a host a special software coworking event in the evening to give developers with day jobs, school or other daytime committments, the opportunity to experience coworking for themselves.  

If you are working on an app in your spare time, bootstrapping a company after hours, or just enjoy working at night, then you should join us on Monday October 22 at Starbucks. We'll be there at 6:00PM. And since Starbucks is open 24 hours, we'll be there until late.
