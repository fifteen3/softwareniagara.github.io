Software Niagara is hosting Niagara's first DemoCamp on September 19, 2012. Join us for an evening of technology demos and networking.

Niagara-based designers and developers will present their technology-related products and services to a room full of designers, developers, entrepreneuers, and investors. It is a great opportunity to see technology built in your own backyard and to get to know the people in Niagara's tech community.

DemoCamp has been held in many cities, including Hamilton, Guelph, Toronto, and Calgary.We are excited to bring this event to Niagara. DemoCamp Niagara will be hosted at On the Front Cafe & Eatery in Thorold, Ontario. It is conventiently located just a few minutes from Brock University and the Pen Centre shopping mall.

We encourage everyone that is interested in technology to come out. Event registration is free and you do not need to demo to attend. Due to limited seating, we encourage you to register as soon as possible.
