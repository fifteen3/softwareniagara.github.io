# Contribute to — or connect with — Software Niagara

<p class="lead">
    As a grassroots organization, we want to be as transparent as possible and encourage participation from all
    members of our community. As such, we will be holding discussions and organizing events in public on GitHub.
    This means you can see what we are doing and jump in at any time if you have a question or want to contribute.

### Ask a question, start a discussion, or contribute

Ask a question or start a discussion by [creating an issue](https://github.com/softwareniagara/feedback/issues/new).
Watch our [feedback repository](https://github.com/softwareniagara/feedback) to follow our activities. We use issues
and milestones to plan events and initiatives. Please contribute if you can help us close an issue or hit a milestone.
