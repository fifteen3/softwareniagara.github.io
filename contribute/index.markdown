# Contribute to — or connect with — Software Niagara

<p class="lead">
    As a grassroots organization, we want to be as transparent as possible and encourage participation from all
    members of our community. As such, we will be holding discussions and organizing events in public on GitHub.
    This means you can see what we are doing and jump in at any time if you have a question or want to contribute.
</p>

We want the blog on this website to be written by the community for the community. Please consider forking
