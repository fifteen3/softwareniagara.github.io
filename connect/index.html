<p class="lead">
    As a grassroots organization, we aim to be as transparent as possible and we encourage participation from
    all members of our community. As such, we hold our discussions and organize our events in public on GitHub.
    This means you can see what we are doing and jump in at any time if you have a question or want to
    contribute.
</p>

<h3>Ask a question, start a discussion, or contribute</h3>

<p>
    Ask a question or start a discussion by <a href="https://github.com/softwareniagara/feedback/issues/new">creating an issue</a>

    activities. We use issues and milestones to plan events and activities. Please contribute if you can help us close
    an issue or hit a milestone.
