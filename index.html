                Software Niagara hosts a weekly coworking session. Local designers, developers, and entrepreneurs gather
                to work independently on their software-related projects and ventures in a social and collaborative
                environment.
            </p>

            <p>
                Coworking is a great way to escape the distractions of your home office while simultaneously satisfy
                your need for human companionship.

                Software Niagara holds quarterly DemoCamps to showcase made-in-Niagara technology and the local talent
                behind it all.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each DemoCamp starts with a keynote, followed by up to six technology demos from local designers,
                developers, and entrepreneurs. The community has an opportunity to see new products and services,
                and ask questions of their developers.
            </p>

            <p>
                DemoCamps have been held all over Canada, including Hamilton, Guelph, Toronto, and Calgary. We are
                proud to bring the tradition to Niagara. Everyone with an interest in technology is encouraged to
                attend.

                meetup where anyone can teach others about a new software technology, or computer setup, or
                programming language, and so on. It's an informal knowledge sharing event.
            </p>
            <p>
                At each event, there will be a few scheduled speakers sharing their tips and tricks. After that,
                attendees are encouraged to get up and share their own tips and tricks. There will be a projector
                and laptop available. Finally, we will end the evening with a round table discussion to plan for what
                we would like to see at future DevTricks and to find volunteers to speak at the next event.

                We started in 2012 with the goal of organizing technology and startup events to build a community that

            <p>
