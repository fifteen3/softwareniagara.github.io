<p class="lead">
    Software Niagara is a grassroots initiative to build a stronger software community and startup culture
    in the Niagara Region.
</p>

<p>
    We are a group of local designers, developers, entrepreneurs, and students who believe that Niagara is
    a great place to create new technology and grow businesses. We believe that sharing, collaboration, and
    community spirit are vital to building a strong technology sector in Niagara.
</p>

<p>
    We are trying to make Niagara a great place to live and work for designers, developers, and entrepreneurs by:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Organizing DemoCamp Niagara to showcase "Made in Niagara" technology</li>
    <li>Organizing hackathons with a focus on open data and civic engagement</li>
    <li>Operating #softwareniagara on IRC</li>
    <li>Promoting Coworking and Startup Drinks</li>
    <li>Promoting local startup and technology groups and events</li>
    <li>Encouraging children and adults to develop computer literacy and programming skills</li>
</ul>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>
    We started in 2012 with the goal of organizing technology and startup events (with a focus on software) to
    build a community that fostered innovation and excellence in Niagara. The inspiration for our grassroots
    effort came from <a href="http://www.softwarehamilton.com">Software Hamilton</a> and
    <a href="http://www.startupnorth.ca">Startup North</a>, both of which were similar efforts that had been
    instrumental in building vibrant tech and startup communities in Hamilton and Toronto, respectively.
</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>
    Software Niagara is a grassroots group. There is no official mandate, nor are there any affiliations with business,
    government, or non-government organizations. All work is carried out by volunteers acting on behalf of themselves.
    Any sponsorship funds are used solely to cover event costs.
