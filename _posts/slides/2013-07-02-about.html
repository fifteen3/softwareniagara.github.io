    <h3>Our mission</h3>
    <p>
        Our mission is to make Niagara a great place to live and work for designers, developers, and
        entrepreneurs.
    </p>

    <p>
        We believe that each one of us has the power to make this mission a reality. Here's what we are doing
        to make it happen:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Organizing DemoCamp Niagara to showcase "Made in Niagara" technology</li>
        <li>Organizing hackathons with a focus on open data and civic engagement</li>
        <li>Operating #softwareniagara on IRC</li>
        <li>Promoting Coworking and Startup Drinks</li>
        <li>Promoting local startup and technology groups and events</li>
        <li>Encouraging children and adults to develop computer literacy and programming skills</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Our history</h3>

    <p>
        We started in 2012 with the goal of organizing technology and startup events to build a community that
        fostered innovation and excellence in Niagara. The inspiration for our grassroots effort came from
        <a href="http://www.softwarehamilton.com">Software Hamilton</a> and
        <a href="http://www.startupnorth.ca">Startup North</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since being founded, we have hosted three DemoCamps, two hackathons, and many nights of coworking. We
        have also began hosting regular DevTricks events. Incredibly, all of our work is done by a group of
        volunteers.
