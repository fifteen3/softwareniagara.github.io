    <h3>Share &amp; learn with your peers</h3>
    <p>
        Software Niagara hosts DevTricks on the third Monday of every month. DevTricks is a casual
        meetup where anyone can teach others about a <strike>new</strike>(it can be old or new) software technology, or computer setup, or
        programming language, and so on. It's an informal knowledge sharing event. It's that event you go to just to say, &ldquo;hey check this out!&rdquo;. If you develop software or want to develop software this is the event you don't want to miss. 
    </p>

        At each event, there will be a few people who have volunteered to share their tips and tricks. After that,
        attendees are encouraged to get up and share their own tips and tricks. There will be a projector
        and laptop available. Finally, we will end the evening with a round table discussion to plan for what
        we would like to see at future DevTricks and to find volunteers to share at the next event. Nothing is set in
        stone, there is no right or wrong it is all about sharing knowledge and helping eachother learn more.
