    <h3>Share &amp; learn with your peers</h3>
    <p>
        Software Niagara hosts DevTricks on the third Monday of every month. DevTricks is a casual
        meetup where anyone can teach others about a new software technology, or computer setup, or
        programming language, and so on. It's an informal knowledge sharing event.
    </p>
    <p>
        At each event, there will be a few scheduled speakers sharing their tips and tricks. After that,
        attendees are encouraged to get up and share their own tips and tricks. There will be a projector
        and laptop available. Finally, we will end the evening with a round table discussion to plan for what
        we would like to see at future DevTricks and to find volunteers to speak at the next event.
