    <h3>Team up and build the next big thing</h3>
    <p>
        Software Niagara regularly holds hackathons. Pair up with a group, choose a problem to tackle, and develop
        the next big thing over a weekend.

        Hackathons are a great opportunity to meet new people, to work with people you have not worked with
        before, to learn from those more experienced than you, and to teach those less experienced than you.
        Generally, our hackathons focus on open data and civic engagement. But the real focus is on skill building
        and knowledge sharing.
