              We met at On the Front Cafe and Eatery in Thorold, Ontario for an evening of technology
              demos. We got to know others in the Niagara tech community and discovered talented individuals in Niagara! Lots more talent to showcase next time! Let us know if you would like to give a demo at DemoCampNiagara2.
