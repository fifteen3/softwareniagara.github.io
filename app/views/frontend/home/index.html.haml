            %h2 Bringing the Niagara Software Community Together
            %p.lead
              We are a group of coders that have started a grassroots movement to foster a stronger software
              community in Niagara.
            %p.lead
              We aim to accomplish this by holding events that will bring together people that share an interest
              in technology.
