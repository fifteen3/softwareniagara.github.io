# Software Niagara

This is the official website of Software Niagara. It is built on DocPad, which is a powerful system for building
website front-ends, using layouts, meta data, pre-processors, partials, skeletons, file watching, querying, and
plugins. It's awesome and fairly language agnostic, making it easy to contribute to this project.

### Getting Started

1. [Install DocPad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad)

2. Clone the project and run the server

    ``` bash
    git clone git://github.com/softwareniagara/software-niagara.git
    cd software-niagara
    npm install
    docpad run
    ```
