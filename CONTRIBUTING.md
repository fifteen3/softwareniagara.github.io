This site is based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

If you're new to Jekyll, take a look at [Jekyll's directory structure](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/)
so you know what goes where.

Place posts in `_posts/`. They should be named in the format `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`.  
For example `2011-12-31-slap-chop.md` or `2012-09-12-sham-wow.textile` or `2013-09-09-schticky.html`.

Jekyll supports two popular content markup formats: [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
and [Textile](http://hobix.github.io/hobix/textile/).

For more info on creating a new post, check out [Jekyll's official docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/).
