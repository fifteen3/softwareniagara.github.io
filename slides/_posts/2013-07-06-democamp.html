    <h3>Made-in-Niagara technology</h3>

    <p>
        Software Niagara holds quarterly DemoCamps to showcase made-in-Niagara technology and the local talent
        behind it all.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each DemoCamp starts with a keynote, followed by up to six technology demos from local designers,
        developers, and entrepreneurs. The community has an opportunity to see new products and services,
        and ask questions of their developers.
    </p>

    <p>
        DemoCamps have been held all over Canada, including Hamilton, Guelph, Toronto, and Calgary. We are
        proud to bring the tradition to Niagara. Everyone with an interest in technology is encouraged to
        attend.
